# Tools

This is a basic collection of Azure tools that I use when building out architecture projects. I'm including a basic README.md file for our documentation.

A good example is a bash shell script to log in to Azure and set the correct tenant and subscription. Other good examples are bash shell scripts or Python scripts to text basic Azure functionality, like the ability to deploy certain resources.

Think of this as basic admin tools for Azure.
