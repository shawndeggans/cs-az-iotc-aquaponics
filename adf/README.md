## ADF includes the following basic structures:
* Deployment Partitions
* Naming Standards
    * Naming Standards
    * Naming Standards Prefix
    * Naming Standards Bicep

* Using nested templates
* Using parameter file per environment
* How does RBAC work?
* Global settings and regional settings
* Deploying from Powershell
