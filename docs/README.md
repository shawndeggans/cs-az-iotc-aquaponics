# Docs
---
Use the docs folder to store documentation for your project. This is a good place to put things like:
- A README.md file that explains what your project does and how to use it
- A CONTRIBUTING.md file that explains how others can contribute to your project
- An images folder for images in your README.md and other documentation
- A wiki that contains additional documentation
- Architecture decision records that use the following format:
    - `docs/adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md`
    - `docs/adr/0002-use-markdown-architectural-decision-records.md`
    - `docs/adr/0003-record-architecture-alternatives.md`
    - `docs/adr/0004-record-architecture-decisions.md`
- A folder for your project's code documentation
