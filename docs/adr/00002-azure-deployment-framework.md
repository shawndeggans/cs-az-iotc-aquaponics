# We will use Azure Deployment Framework (ADF) to deploy our infrastructure.

# ADF is a set of tools and patterns that help you deploy and manage your Azure resources. It is a set of best practices for Azure deployments.
Context: ADF is a set of tools and patterns that help you deploy and manage your Azure resources. It is a set of best practices for Azure deployments.
Decision: We will use ADF to deploy our infrastructure.
Alternatives: We considered the following alternatives:
    * winging it: We could just wing it and see what happens. This is not a good idea.
    * Azure Resource Manager (ARM): We could use ARM templates to deploy our infrastructure. This is a good option, but ADF is a better option. We want to use BICEP as much as possible.
    * Terraform: We could use Terraform to deploy our infrastructure. This is a good option, but ADF is a better option. We want to use BICEP as much as possible.
Consequences: ADF is a good option for deploying our infrastructure. It is a set of best practices for Azure deployments. It is a good option for us to use.
